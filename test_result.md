# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: |
  1. Bug Fix: When creating a new watchlist, every time you type a letter into the text field it kicks you out of it so you have to click in the text field again after every letter. Need to fix this so typing works continuously.
  
  2. New Feature: Instead of opening up to "Shadow's Picks", implement a home screen with market overview data including NYSE Indices, stock heatmap, top gainers, top losers, and other relevant market data for quick NYSE overview.

This properly handles exchange prefixes like 'NASDAQ:XCUR' -> 'XCUR', 'NYSE:GRND' -> 'GRND'. COMPREHENSIVE TESTING COMPLETED: ✅ GET /api/watchlists returns 2 existing watchlists with exchange-prefixed tickers ✅ Individual stock APIs work for AAPL, XCUR, FBRX, GTLB ✅ Ticker parsing correctly handles 'NASDAQ:XCUR' -> 'XCUR' ✅ 'Imported Watchlist' now returns 6 stocks (was 0 before fix) ✅ 'test' watchlist returns 3 stocks ✅ New test watchlist with mixed tickers returns 4 stocks including 'NASDAQ:XCUR' ✅ Backend logs show proper parsing: 'Processing ticker: NASDAQ:XCUR -> XCUR' ✅ All 15/15 watchlist tests passed.

SOLUTION: Redesigned scan_stocks() to: 1) Apply basic filtering only (remove junk, keep scoring potential), 2) Score ALL remaining stocks with technical analysis, 3) Sort by score first (4/4 highest priority), 4) Build final list prioritizing 4/4 then 3/4 then 2/4 stocks, 5) Added score distribution reporting.

    message: "CRITICAL STOCK CARD UNIFORMITY ISSUE IDENTIFIED - Comprehensive testing reveals that stock cards are NOT uniform across the application. MAJOR FINDINGS: ❌ Home screen stock cards are missing critical Shadow's Picks format elements: Price display, Score badges (X/4), RSI indicators, and AI Insight buttons. Only 4/8 key features match between Home and Shadow's Picks. ❌ Required sections MISSING from Home screen: 'Featured Stock Analysis' and 'Highest Volume Stocks' sections are not present. ✅ Navigation works: Portfolio tab loads correctly, but News tab has issues. ✅ Index cards correctly use different format (IndexCard vs StockCard). ROOT CAUSE: Home screen uses new unified StockCard component, but Shadow's Picks still uses old inline StockCard from App.js. This creates inconsistent user experience where stocks look completely different depending on which tab you're viewing. URGENT ACTION REQUIRED: Main agent must update Shadow's Picks to use the same unified StockCard component and implement missing Home screen sections."

    message: "IMPLEMENTING UNIVERSAL STOCK CARD FIX - Starting implementation to fix stock card uniformity issues identified by testing agent. Key fixes: 1) Replace inline StockCard usage in Shadow's Picks tab with external StockCard.js component to ensure visual consistency, 2) Update header image to use new pipengine.jpg provided by user, 3) Remove unused inline StockCard definition from App.js, 4) Tidy up home screen layout for better visual appearance. This will ensure all stock displays (except indices) use the exact same Shadow's Picks format across the application."

    message: "CRITICAL SCORING PRIORITY FIX IMPLEMENTED: User identified major issue - system showing mostly 1/4 and 2/4 scored stocks instead of prioritizing 4/4 stocks. ROOT CAUSE: Pre-filtering by fundamentals was eliminating high-scoring stocks before technical analysis was applied. SOLUTION: Complete redesign of scan_stocks() logic: 1) Replaced aggressive pre-filtering with basic quality filter (only removes obvious junk), 2) Score ALL remaining stocks with technical analysis first, 3) Sort by score descending (4/4 highest priority), 4) Build final selection prioritizing 4/4 stocks, then 3/4, then 2/4 only if needed, 5) Added detailed score distribution reporting. System now GUARANTEES highest-scored stocks are returned first. Ready for testing."

    message: "CLAUDE INTEGRATION TESTING COMPLETED WITH EXCELLENT RESULTS: Comprehensive testing of Anthropic Claude integration shows outstanding functionality across both endpoints. PRIMARY ENDPOINT /api/ai-chat: ✅ Successfully tested with diverse financial questions (market outlook, stock analysis, trading strategies, portfolio management) ✅ All responses use claude-3-haiku-20240307 model with provider: 'claude' ✅ Response quality is professional with 2-3 sentence informative financial advice ✅ Proper error handling (400 for empty messages) ✅ Fallback system works when Claude API fails. SECONDARY ENDPOINT /api/stocks/{ticker}/claude-insight: ✅ Tested with major stocks (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, TSLA, NVDA) ✅ Returns comprehensive technical analysis with price, RSI, change_percent data ✅ Claude provides detailed insights including technical analysis, sentiment, and key risks/opportunities ✅ Response format matches specification with all required fields. OVERALL RESULTS: 47/50 backend tests passed (94% success rate). Claude integration significantly enhances ShadowBeta's AI capabilities with professional financial analysis. Both endpoints are production-ready and working excellently. The conversion from Gemini to Claude has been successful and provides superior financial assistant functionality."
